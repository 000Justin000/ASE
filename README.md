# QChem Interface to Atomic Simulation Environment

### This repository hosts the code and some example usage for the following paper:  
[Unraveling substituent effects on the glass transition temperatures of biorenewable polyesters](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05269-3)  
Xiaopengyu, [Junteng Jia](https://000justin000.github.io/), et al  
Nat comm., 2018.

Our paper computationally investigated the rotational flexibilities in a series of biorenewable polyesters with QChem, which bring insight to future design of polymers with high glass transition temperatures.
